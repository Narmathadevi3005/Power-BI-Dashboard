I have utilized the BMW sales dataset to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, designed to provide deep insights into sales performance, revenue distribution, and business trends. This dashboard consists of multiple visual components covering Models, Regions, Fuel Types, and Price Comparisons. Each visualization is structured to effectively interpret and present key aspects of the dataset.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The report highlights crucial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including:
•	Total Sales Volume – The overall number of BMW units sold across all regions and models.
•	Total Revenue (Price USD) – The total revenue generated from BMW sales globally.
•	Model-wise Contribution – The percentage share of each model (3 Series, 5 Series, X Series, i Series, etc.) in overall sales and revenue.
•	Regional Sales Performance – Comparison of sales across regions (Asia, Europe, North America, Middle East, Africa, South America).
•	Fuel Type Analysis – Distribution of sales based on fuel types (Diesel, Petrol, Hybrid, Electric).
Visualizations and Insights
To facilitate a data-driven approach, the dashboard incorporates various charts and insights, including:
•	Sales Distribution by Model (Pie Chart): Shows percentage contribution of each BMW model to total sales.
•	Revenue by Model & Region (Bar Chart): Compares revenue contribution across regions for different BMW models.
•	Price Comparison (Bar Chart): Highlights price differences across models and markets.
•	Sales Trend by Region & Model (Line Chart): Tracks changes in sales performance across regions over time.
•	Map Visualization: Provides a geographical view of BMW’s global sales footprint.
•	Tree Map (Revenue & Sales Volume): Evaluates the contribution of each model in terms of both units sold and total revenue.
Insights Derived
1.	X-Series models dominate in sales volume, indicating strong consumer demand for SUVs.
2.	Luxury models (7 Series, i8) generate high revenue despite lower sales volumes, showing strong profitability.
3.	Europe and Asia emerge as the top-performing regions, with consistent demand across all BMW models.
4.	Hybrid and Electric models show growth trends, reflecting a global shift towards sustainable mobility.
5.	X3 model stands out with the highest sales volume and significant revenue contribution.
